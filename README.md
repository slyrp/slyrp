### Hi, I'm slyrp.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my soon to be PBC repository, but for now I'm on [ACNH](https://github.com/slyrp/ACNH).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mainly Javascript, but HTML, CSS, and Python are some others.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am actually really bad at coding and make ChatGPT do all my work.
- ðŸ“« You can open an issue or find me on Discord: slyrp#0646.
- ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are he/him.
